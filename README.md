# vido
vido (video do) is a CLI tool, written in Go, to help manage YouTube videos downloaded using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)/youtube-dl/youtube-dlc. This project will be pedagogical in nature and attempt to follow these [guidelines](https://clig.dev/).

# Features (WIP):
* reading archive files of locally downloaded videos to see current status of them on YouTube (exist, deleted, private, age restricted, etc)
* updating the generated archive file to reflect videos which may be removed from the local library
* produce a CSV file with as much data as possible about the library for further analysis by a user
