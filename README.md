# yt-archive-status
A command line utility, written in Go, to parse yt-dlp/youtube-dl/youtube-dlp archive files to see current status of locally downloaded videos on YouTube. High level statistics are printed to the console and a CSV file is produced as output for further analysis by a user.

Consider renaming this to `yt-archive-helper` and creating a suite of helpers for interacting with the archive (i.e. also updating it).
